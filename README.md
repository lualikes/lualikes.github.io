This was a project for the Girls Who Code program where you had to make an Activist Toolkit website.
I chose to talk about the inequalities and the unique circumstances when it comes to the Hispanic community and cancer. 
This is a cause that I have personal experience in, which is why it's so important to me that people learn more about it.
My webpage is called Sana because it can mean heal. but also because of an old sayings that adults say to their children when they're sick "Sana, sana colita de rana. Si no sana hoy sanara ma√±ana."
